File Opening Modes
Mode                                     |                                   Description
r ---------------------------------------|-------------------Opens an existing text file for reading purpose.                
W----------------------------------------|---------Opens a text file for writing. If it does not exist, then a new file is created. Here your program will start
                                         |               writing content from the beginning of the file.
a----------------------------------------|-----------Opens a text file for writing in appending mode. If it does not exist, then a new file is created. Here
                                         |               your program will start appending content in the existing file content.
r+  -------------------------------------|----------Opens a text file for both reading and writing. If the file exists, loads it into memory and set up a
                                                     pointer to the first character in it. If file doesn't exist it returns null.  

w+     ----------------------------------|-------Opens a text file for both reading and writing. If file is present, it first destroys the file to zero length if
                                                    it exists, otherwise creates a file if it does not exist.
a+  -------------------------------------|--------Opens a text file for both reading and writing. It creates the file if it does not exist. The reading will
                                               start from the beginning but writing can only be appended.
